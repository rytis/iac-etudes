# Infrastructure-as-Code Ã‰tudes

## Pre-requisites

Install the following locally:
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- [Terrform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- [Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/tutorials/docker-get-started/get-started-install-cli)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

Set up AWS account and CLI, so that it is [SSO authenticated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.html). Make sure you can run without errors:
- `aws sso login`
- `aws s3 ls`

## State store

Each etude is completely independent and will use separate state store. Run the following command to create new state store configuration on relevant (and supported) cloud provider:

```
$ ./state_store.sh create <cloud_provider> <etude_name>
```

Where `cloud_provider` is supported cloud provider name (eg "aws") and `etude_name` is name of an etude found in `etudes/` directory.

Cloud provider specific configuration is located in `ansible/vars/cloud_config.yml`.
